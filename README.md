## Getting Started

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the folder. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helium/explorer.git
cd explorer
```

2. Second, install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

3. Edit your environment variables

- Open the `.sample.env` file located at the root of the project
- [Create a Mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) and [copy your public access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
- Paste it in place of `123` for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY` variable. That line should now look like this:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY=pk.ey[...the rest of your access token...]
```

- Rename the file "`.env`" (delete "`.sample`" from the file name)

4. Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

And open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file and save your changes.

5. Create a new logically-named branch. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b witness-list-enhancements
```

6. Push your changes to GitHub and create a PR against the master branch, linking the PR to any relevant issues.
